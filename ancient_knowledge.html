      We don't enjoy just the surrounding of the game, we also have a chance to learn about the cultures, the languages that the people used, what kind of tools they used,
      how did weapons looked back then, how did people dressed, what did they eat. We have an opportunity to get to know many people who left their mark on history. We can
      talk with them, get a glimpse of their lifestyle. Learn about the battles that happened, learn about the religion and learn how the people did the trade.
