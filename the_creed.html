    <p1>
      Since the begining of the time, the human kind long for the power, becoming a ruler of the world was one of the way for one to seize it. Slaughter of the people who stood on ones way was inevitable.
      Disgusted by the slaughtering the people decided to make a new Order, an Order that will bring an end to the tyranny.
      The Assassin's Creed, often referred to as the Creed, was a code and guiding philosophy of the Assassin Order upheld from the beginnings of the time until the modern era.
      It restricted unnecessary slaughter of innocents. It was meant to create peace not only within the world, but within the individual.
